## Music üéµ

To use your own music, compress all your MP3 Files into a ZIP file and upload it somewhere. Provide the link to the ZIP file in the Frontend.

It is recommended to use Services such as [Filebin](https://filebin.net) to upload your ZIP file. If you decide to use Filebin, provide the Frontend with the absolute path to the ZIP file by using More -> Download File, e.g. (use this [Popular TT songs ZIP](https://filebin.net/klylrens0uk2pnrg/drive-download-20240209T180019Z-001.zip), not this [Popular TT songs](https://filebin.net/2avx134kdibc4c3q))

You can also just move your MP3 files into the `Songs` folder. 

## Fonts üÖ∞

Add your fonts to the `fonts/` folder, and load them by specifying the font name on line `124` in `Backend/video.py`.

## FAQ ü§î

### My ImageMagick binary is not being detected

Make sure you set your path to the ImageMagick binary correctly in the `.env` file, it should look something like this:

IMAGEMAGICK_BINARY="C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick-7.1.0-Q16\\magick.exe"
